# 1.20.0 (2018-08-30)

**Note** Updating to this version of SKY UX Builder requires that SKY UX also be updated to 2.21.0 because it takes advantages of new features in SKY UX.

- Minor tweaks to code coverage instrumentation for SKY UX libraries. [#457](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/457)
- CSS imports now reference the new `@skyux/theme` library that is part of the latest version of SKY UX 2. [#458](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/458)

- Addressed a minor issue when logging build status. [#460](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/460)
- SPAs can now force a legal entity context and allow users to pick a legal entity from a list if the user belongs to more than one legal entity, or to automatically select a default legal entity if the user only belongs to one legal entity. To use this feature, ensure that the `parameters` section of `skyuxconfig.json` specifies `leid` as a required parameter. [#461](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/461) Example:

```
"params": {
  "leid": {
    "required": true
  }
}
```

The value of `./node_modules/@blackbaud/skyux-builder/skyuxconfig-schema.json`is applied to the default template and can be retroactively added to older SPAs. [#358](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/358)
- Created the `browserSet` property in `skyuxconfig.json` to control which browsers to use during testing.  Applicable values are `speedy`, `quirky`, and `paranoid`. [#431](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/431)
- Created the `excludeFromRequest` property in `skyuxconfig.json` to exlude parameters from requests. [#432](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/432)

# 1.15.0 (2018-05-11)

# 1.14.0 (2018-04-19)

- SKY UX libraries can now define their own locale files for localizing strings.  [#379](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/379)

- Changed the Webpack source map devtool from `cheap-module-eval-source-map` to `source-map`.  This fixes source maps in Firefox.  [#384](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/384)

- Added the ability to resolve a missing environment ID context before rendering the application.  For instance, if the `envid` parameter is required by your application, but none is supplied either through the query string or the SPA's `skyuxconfig.json` file, the user will be presented with a screen to select an environment. If the user is only in one environment, the application will automatically be reloaded with that environment.  [#399](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder/pull/399)

To opt into this new behavior, simply add the following to your `skyuxconfig.json` file (or merge it with your existing `params` section if it already exists):

```
"params": {
  "envid": {
    "required": true
  }
}
```
